                    OpenGPSR processes data based on <strong>legitimate interest</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR),
                    consisting in maintaining a publicly useful database of business contact details in the context of
                    product safety
                    and preventing abuse (spam, attacks, false reports).

                <span class="legal-ref">
                    We apply the principle of data minimization and assess the balance of interests: we publish only
                    information necessary in the context of GPSR
                    and strive to avoid personal data of individuals.

                <h2>1. What data do we collect in OpenGPSR database?</h2>
                <p>We collect data needed to identify the economic operator and their public contact points in the
                    context of GPSR:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Entity data:</strong> name, country, (optionally) address, website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact data (contact point):</strong> public email addresses and phone numbers
                        indicated by the entity (e.g., <em>compliance@company.com</em>), or disclosed in public sources
                        (e.g., "Contact", "Imprint").</li>
                    <li><strong>Source data and change history:</strong> link to source, source type, dates, record
                        version information, and verification status (e.g., <code>UNVERIFIED</code>,
                        <code>PRIMARY_CONFIRMED</code>, <code>OUTDATED</code>).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> OpenGPSR aims to process B2B data. If a contact appearing in a public
                    source looks private
                    (e.g., email containing a first and last name), we treat it as potentially sensitive and may
                    restrict its publication.
                    We prefer publishing functional addresses (e.g., <em>safety@</em>, <em>support@</em>,
                    <em>compliance@</em>).
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Technical data and logs (user and report data)</h2>
                <p>If you use the service (browse the site, use the API, or submit data), the system may record:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP address and technical details:</strong> server logs (e.g., IP, user-agent, request
                        time) for security, diagnostics, and abuse prevention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Submission metadata:</strong> in case of reporting data via form, information needed for
                        audit may be saved (e.g., report ID, time, source, possibly account ID if login is implemented
                        in the future).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Retention period:</strong> technical logs are stored for no longer than necessary for
                    security and accountability purposes.
                    By default, we strive for short retention periods (e.g., 30–90 days), unless an incident requiring
                    longer analysis occurs.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. No Marketing Tracking</h2>
                <p>The OpenGPSR project respects digital privacy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not use marketing analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel).</li>
                    <li>We do not sell behavioral data to ad brokers.</li>
                    <li>We do not profile users.</li>
                    <li>We use only technical cookies necessary for service operation (if required).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Your Rights (Correction, Restriction, Objection)</h2>
                <p>
                    If data concerns your company or you personally (e.g., private contact), you can submit a request
                    for correction or publication restriction.
                    OpenGPSR is not an official registry, but we react to credible reports and strive to minimize the
                    risk of publishing personal data.
                </p>

                <div class="contact-box">
                    <strong>Reporting Procedure (Rectification / Notice &amp; Takedown):</strong><br><br>
                    If data is incorrect, outdated, or contains a private contact:<br>
                    1. Write to us via the <strong>Contact Form</strong> on the main page.<br>
                    2. In the subject line put: <em>[GDPR] Request for correction / publication restriction</em><br>
                    3. Indicate the record URL and describe the scope of the request (correction / hiding contact /
                    marking as OUTDATED).<br>
                    4. If possible, attach a source confirming the change (e.g., current "Contact" page).<br><br>
                    <em>We try to react as quickly as possible. In cases requiring additional verification, we may ask
                        for clarification.</em>

                    Note: due to versioning and change audit, some information may be stored in the audit layer
                    (e.g., as proof of report and its handling), while being hidden from public view.

                <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    OpenGPSR publishes part of the data in open form (public view) and makes it available via API
                    intended primarily for reading.
                    If you use public data, remember that the license (e.g., CC BY 4.0) does not waive obligations under
                    GDPR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entities downloading data and processing it in their own systems may act as separate data
                    controllers
                    and are responsible for compliance with relevant regulations in their context (purpose, scope,
                    retention, legal basis).
