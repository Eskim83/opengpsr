                Analysis of the operational gap created after the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2023/988.

                <h2>1. New Obligations (Regulation)</h2>
                <div class="text-block">
                    The GPSR (General Product Safety Regulation) introduces a requirement
                    to provide consumers in the EU with clear identification and contact details
                    of the manufacturer and — if the manufacturer is not established in the EU —
                    the appointed Responsible Person within the Union.
                </div>
                <div class="text-block">
                    This obligation applies in particular to online sales
                    and must be fulfilled <strong>at the level of each product offer</strong>.

                <h2>2. Operational Problem (Lack of Infrastructure)</h2>
                <div class="text-block">
                    The regulation creates a clear legal requirement but does not provide
                    any common technical mechanism for its implementation.
                    There is no central, public registry of Responsible Persons
                    within the meaning of GPSR.

                <div class="gap-analysis">
                    <span class="gap-title">Operational Gap Analysis</span>
                    In practice, thousands of sellers and e-commerce system integrators
                    are forced to repeatedly manually search for the same data
                    for the same brands and manufacturers. This leads to duplication of work,
                    inconsistent data, and compliance errors.

                <h2>3. Role of OpenGPSR</h2>
                <div class="text-block">
                    OpenGPSR was created as a grassroots technical initiative
                    aimed at filling this infrastructural gap.
                    The project acts as a middleware layer
                    between distributed data sources and sales systems.
                </div>
                <div class="text-block">
                    Data is aggregated, versioned, and marked with a source of origin,
                    allowing for its automated use in compliance processes
                    without the need to manually determine the Responsible Person every time.

            </section>

                <h2>4. What OpenGPSR Does NOT Do</h2>
                <div class="text-block">
                    OpenGPSR performs no certification or advisory functions.
                    The project provides only standardized technical data
                    in a format enabling system integration.

                    <li>It does not confirm product compliance with regulations.</li>
                    <li>It does not replace the seller's obligations under GPSR.</li>
