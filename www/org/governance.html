                            Coordinates the direction of development and makes tie-breaking decisions on technical

                            (form / GitHub Issue). Publication decisions are based on evidence (sources) and data

                <h2>2. Decision Making</h2>
                <p>
                    OpenGPSR operates on an "evidence first" model: every decision to add or change data should have
                    an indicated source (URL / registry / document / official website). In practice:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No source</strong> usually means no publication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conflicting sources</strong> mean marking a dispute and cautious publication (e.g.,
                        status <code>DISPUTED</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>API</strong> is designed primarily for data reading; changes/reports are prioritized via
                        the form and verification process.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>In open projects, conflicts are inevitable. We use a simple escalation path:</p>

                <div class="flow-step">
                    <span class="flow-title">A. Content Disputes (e.g., "is this the correct contact?")</span>
                    The strength of evidence (source) decides. If evidence is equivalent or ambiguous,
                    data may be published as disputed (e.g., <code>DISPUTED</code>) or marked for re-verification
                    (<code>HISTORICAL</code>/<code>OUTDATED</code>).
                    The goal is pragmatism and risk minimization, not "winning the argument".
                </div>

                <div class="flow-step">
                    <span class="flow-title">B. Technical Disputes (e.g., "how to model data / API?")</span>
                    We strive for consensus in technical discussion. In the absence of agreement,
                    the Lead Maintainer chooses the solution safest for system stability, compatibility, and security.
                </div>

                <div class="flow-step">
                    <span class="flow-title">C. Legal Disputes (e.g., "entity demands removal or correction")</span>
                    <strong>"Safety First" Principle:</strong> in case of a credible legal report or risk of rights
                    infringement,
                    data may be <strong>immediately hidden from public view</strong> pending clarification.
                    OpenGPSR is not a party to legal disputes and does not conduct litigation.
                    The priority is limiting project exposure and rapid response.
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Philosophy: Right to be wrong</h2>
                <ul class="philosophy-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Iteration over perfection:</strong> the database will not be 100% perfect. Records may
                        contain errors at the time of addition.
                        The project assumes versioning and corrections, not a "one-time truth".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fix, don't defend:</strong> if data is incorrect or outdated — we correct it based on
                        sources.
                        Change history is an element of audit (versions, sources, verification statuses), not a field
                        for proving points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Neutrality:</strong> OpenGPSR does not evaluate companies or products. We do not grant
                        "certificates" and do not publish opinions.
                        We provide identification and contact data needed to automate compliance processes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Project Continuity and Succession</h2>
                <p>
                    The project is designed so that it can survive a change of maintainers.
                    The public view of data may be periodically exported to open formats (e.g., JSON),
                    enabling independent archiving and launching a project copy (fork) if needed.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.95em; color: #64748b;">
                    Note: export is not a "guarantee of completeness" — it is a snapshot of the public state, intended
                    for integration and reading.
